# smsup-java-spring-implementation

This small API implements Smsup.es REST API for sms management. The current API just implements the send process but can be easily extended to implement all the other features.

The API has been written for a Java Spring Boot application, but can also be used in a Spring MVC application or any other Java application as long as the RestTemplate is substituted with its respective counterpart. 

The API also uses project Lombok.
